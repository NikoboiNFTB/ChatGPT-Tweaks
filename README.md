# ChatGPT-Tweaks

A collection of useful user scripts to enhance the ChatGPT experience by automating certain actions and modifying UI behaviors. These tweaks are designed to simplify interactions with ChatGPT and improve usability.

## Scripts

>> Note: Easy installation via the install links below requires a userscript manager that supports installation from raw files. [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is the officially supported and tested manager.

### 1. ChatGPT - Auto Continue Generating ([install](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/ChatGPT-Tweaks/raw/refs/heads/main/auto-continue-generating.user.js))

Automatically clicks the "Continue generating" button when it appears.

**How it works**: 
- Observes the page for changes and clicks the "Continue generating" button when it appears.

### 2. ChatGPT - Auto "Stay Logged Out" ([install](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/ChatGPT-Tweaks/raw/refs/heads/main/auto-stay-logged-out.user.js))

Automatically clicks the "Stay logged out" option when the login prompt is shown.

**How it works**:
- This script checks for the "Stay logged out" link and clicks it when detected.
- It also observes the page to handle any dynamic loading of the prompt.

### 3. ChatGPT - Remove Fade ([install](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/ChatGPT-Tweaks/raw/refs/heads/main/remove-fade.user.js))

Removes the 'content-fade' effect at the bottom of the ChatGPT page, useful when using browsers like LibreWolf and DarkReader.
